 🔒 Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

 📜 **Project Overview**
This project implements a secure data hiding system using image steganography. It allows users to embed confidential messages into digital images, ensuring that the hidden data remains imperceptible to the human eye. The system uses a combination of steganography and passcode-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access and ensure secure communication.



 🎯 **Key Features**
- 🔐 Secure message embedding into images  
- 🖼️ Imperceptible data hiding without altering image quality  
- 🗝️ Password-based authentication for decryption  
- ⚡ Simple and user-friendly Python implementation using OpenCV  
- 💾 Supports image encryption and decryption in separate modules
